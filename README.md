### AI-Powered Voice-Controlled Visual Assistant for the Visually Impaired

Dristi is an accessibility-focused AI application that enables blind and visually impaired users to understand their surroundings using voice commands and real-time scene description. The system combines computer vision, speech recognition, multilingual translation, and speech synthesis to create a fully hands-free interaction experience.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Dristi allows users to:

* Capture images using voice commands
* Receive detailed scene descriptions
* Extract and read text from images (OCR)
* Automatically detect spoken language
* Translate captions into the user’s language
* Hear responses through speech synthesis

The goal is to eliminate screen dependency and create a seamless, real-world assistive tool.
